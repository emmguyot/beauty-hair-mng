<h1>Help for the form<a class="nohover" href="javascript:window.close()" onMouseOver="document.quit_gif.src='../images/quit2.gif'" onMouseOut="document.quit_gif.src='../images/quit.gif'"><img name="quit_gif" src="../images/quit.gif" border=0 alt="Close the window" align="absmiddle"></a></h1>
<p>
The form presents the whole of information in order to allow you to act on this information: Modify, Create, Remove, Duplicate, Print... 
</p>
<p> The obligatory data are posted in stand-up letters and the optional data are in <i>italics</i>. 
    Thus, for example to create a customer, only the name is obligatory. 
    However it is highly advised to obtain the most information possible in
    order to be able to carry out mailings, statistics...
</p>
<p> On certain screens containing a list of modifiable data, a green line is posted. 
    This working line allows the input of a new line which is then added 
    with the button <img src=../images/plus.gif> at the end of the line.
    Without validation on this button, information of the new line is likely to be lost.
</p>
<p>
In bottom of the screen, the possible actions vary from one screen to another. The actions are as follows:
<ul>
   <li>Update: After the modification of information, this action carries out the 
      recording of the modifications of the card in progress. 
   </li>
   <li>Duplicate:  In order to accelerate the successive inputs, this action creates 
      a copy of the card in progress and records it.  You can then modify it without modifying 
      the initial card.  
   </li>
   <li>Print:  Launch the print of information of the card in a preset format. 
      This action is available only when one format exists:  The invoice for example. 
      However, you can always print by clicking on the right button of the mouse and 
      by using the Print option which is displayed in the menu.  
   </li>
   <li>Remove:  This action removes the card in progress. 
      So that the deletion is allowed, the card should not be used by other information. 
      For example you cannot remove a customer if it has invoices. 
   </li>
   <li>List: Post the list of information</li>
</ul>
